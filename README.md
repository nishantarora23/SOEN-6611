# METRICSTICS
## Project Overview
The METRICSTICS project endeavours to create a comprehensive system for analyzing data through central tendency, frequency, and variability measures. It will handle both real-world data from authoritative sources and artificially generated data. METRICSTICS will calculate essential descriptive statistics such as minimum, maximum, mode, median, mean, mean, absolute, and standard deviation. The system will accommodate a random number of data values, allowing flexibility in data inputs. With meticulously annotated problem sets guiding the development process, METRICSTICS aims to be a versatile tool for researchers, analysts, and professionals across industries, contributing significantly to the field of descriptive statistics.
